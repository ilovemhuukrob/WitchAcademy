Sheree : Esme!
Sheree : I told you. Don't mess with my teacher!
Esme : Wait, before you...
Sheree : No matter what you say, I hate you at all!
Sheree : This apple, you made it? I never thought you can make this apple look   tasty.
Esme : That's the thing I had to give to Teacher Veneno. Bring it back!
Sheree : Are you giving it to Teacher Veneno? How dare you!
Avilia : That's enough!
Avilia : Why did you hurt people who didn't want to fight? Aren't you ashamed?
Sheree : Why do you always mind our business, Avilia?
Avilia : Your actions, It's not my cup of tea.
Avilia : Wait !
Sheree : Why are you so fussy?
Avilia : Bring that apple back to Esme.
Sheree : *laughing*
Sheree : If I do not return this apple back...
Sheree : then why? come and get it, idiot!
Avilia : You idiot!, play alone!
Esme : A...Avilia, What shall we do?
Avilia : Why? Is this apple important to you?
Esme : not really, but the reason why is...
Esme : that Apple is dangerous because it can lure monsters out.
Esme : If a monster or someone accidentally eats it... It will explode itself.
Avilia : W...Why did you bring such dangerous stuff to Academy?!
Esme : I...I
Avilia : No time to talk! Must hurry to stop before anything happens!
Avilia : I'll follow Sheree, and you find the other way to stop her!
